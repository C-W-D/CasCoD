Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The customer and the chef discuss their culinary training.
Options:
(A) It is the customer's culinary training
(B) It is the chef's culinary training
(C) Ambiguous

Right Response: Here we need to determine who the pronoun "their" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "their", namely the customer and the chef. The verb "discuss" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the customer and Y the chef. The sentence is then of the form "X and Y discuss (X or Y)'s culinary training."
Let's consider X first: "X and Y discuss X's culinary training." This case doesn't make much sense, as it would be odd for the customer to discuss their own culinary training with the chef.
Now, consider Y: "X and Y discuss Y's culinary training." This case makes sense, as it is common for a chef to discuss their culinary training with customers.
Because in this context, X is the customer and Y is the chef, the answer should be the chef. Therefore, the answer is (B).

Wrong Response: Here we need to determine who the pronoun "their" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "their", namely the customer and the chef. The verb "discuss" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the customer and Y the chef. The sentence is then of the form "X and Y discuss (X or Y)'s culinary training."
Let's consider X first: "X and Y discuss X's culinary training." This case makes sense, because X and Y might be talking about X's culinary training.
Now, consider Y: "X and Y discuss Y's culinary training." This case also makes sense, because X and Y might be talking about Y's culinary training.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. Therefore, the answer is (C).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Before she sent the letter, Alex did not know Taylor.
Options:
(A) Alex sent the letter
(B) Taylor sent the letter
(C) Ambiguous

Right Response: Here we need to determine who the pronoun "she" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "she", namely Alex and Taylor. The verb "sent" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Alex and Y be Taylor. The sentence is then of the form "Before X sent the letter, X did not know Y."
Let's consider Y first: "Before X sent the letter, X did not know Y." This case makes sense, as it implies that Alex did not know Taylor before sending the letter.
Now, consider X: "Before X sent the letter, Y did not know X." This case also makes sense, as it implies that Taylor did not know Alex before the letter was sent.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. Therefore, the answer is (C).

Wrong Response: Here we need to determine who the pronoun "she" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "she", namely Alex and Taylor. The verb "sent" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Alex and Y be Taylor. The sentence is then of the form "Before X sent the letter, X did not know Y."
Let's consider X first: "Before X sent the letter, X did not know Y." This case doesn't make sense, because if X is the one sending the letter, they would already know Y before sending it.
Now, consider Y: "Before X sent the letter, Y did not know Y." This case makes sense, as it implies that Y received the letter from X and got to know X through the letter.
Because in this context, X is Alex and Y is Taylor, the answer should be Taylor. Therefore, the answer is (B).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: After meeting with the producers, Sam goes to their office.
Options:
(A) It is Sam's office
(B) It is the producers' office
(C) Ambiguous

Right Response: Here we need to determine who the pronoun "their" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "their", namely Sam's and the producers'. The verb "meeting" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Sam and Y the producers. The sentence is then of the form "After meeting with Y, X goes to (X or Y)'s office."
Let's consider Y first: "After meeting with Y, X goes to Y's office." This case makes sense, because after meeting with the producers, Sam might need to go to their office for further discussions or work.
Now, consider X: "After meeting with Y, X goes to X's office." This case also makes sense, because after meeting with the producers, Sam might need to go back to their own office to continue their own work.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. Therefore, the answer is (C).

Wrong Response: Here we need to determine who the pronoun "their" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "their", namely Sam's and the producers'. The verb "meeting" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Sam and Y the producers. The sentence is then of the form "After meeting with Y, X goes to (X or Y)'s office."
Let's consider Y first: "After meeting with Y, X goes to Y's office." This case makes sense, because after meeting with the producers, Sam might go to their office.
Now, consider X: "After meeting with Y, X goes to X's office." This case doesn't make sense, because if Sam is meeting with the producers, it is more likely that Sam would go to the producers' office, not their own office.
Because in this context, X is Sam and Y is the producers, the answer should be the producers'. Therefore, the answer is (B).

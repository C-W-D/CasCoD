Evaluate the result of a random Boolean expression. Your response should conclude with the format "Therefore, the answer is".

Q: not ( ( not not True ) ) is
H: The correct answer is False.
A: Let's think step by step.
Remember that (i) expressions inside brackets are always evaluated first and that (ii) the order of operations from highest priority to lowest priority is "not", "and", "or", respectively.
We first simplify this expression "Z" as follows: "Z = not ( ( not not True ) ) = not ( ( A ) )" where "A = not not True".
Let's evaluate A: A = not not True = not (not True) = not False = True.
Plugging in A, we get: Z = not ( ( A ) ) = not ( ( True ) ) = not True = False. Therefore, the answer is False.

Q: True and False and not True and True is
H: The correct answer is False.
A: Let's think step by step.
Remember that (i) expressions inside brackets are always evaluated first and that (ii) the order of operations from highest priority to lowest priority is "not", "and", "or", respectively.
We first simplify this expression "Z" as follows: "Z = True and False and not True and True = A and B" where "A = True and False" and "B = not True and True".
Let's evaluate A: A = True and False = False.
Let's evaluate B: B = not True and True = not (True and True) = not (True) = False.
Plugging in A and B, we get: Z = A and B = False and False = False. Therefore, the answer is False.

Q: not not ( not ( False ) ) is
H: The correct answer is True.
A: Let's think step by step.
Remember that (i) expressions inside brackets are always evaluated first and that (ii) the order of operations from highest priority to lowest priority is "not", "and", "or", respectively.
We first simplify this expression "Z" as follows: "Z = not not ( not ( False ) ) = not not ( A )" where "A = not ( False )".
Let's evaluate A: A = not ( False ) = not False = True.
Plugging in A, we get: Z = not not ( A ) = not not (True) = not False = True. Therefore, the answer is True.

Q: Which sentence has the correct adjective order:
Options:
(A) triangular new Vietnamese steel tiny awful pink match
(B) awful tiny new triangular pink Vietnamese steel match

Right Response: When there is more than one adjective before a noun, the adjectives need to respect the following order before a noun: "[1. opinion] [2. size] [3. age] [4. shape] [5. color] [6. origin] [7. material] [8. purpose] noun".
Option (A): "triangular new Vietnamese steel tiny awful pink match". (1) "triangular" falls into the shape category. (2) "new" falls into the age category. (3) "Vietnamese" falls into the origin category. (4) "steel" falls into the material category. (5) "tiny" falls into the size category. (6) "awful" falls into the opinion category. (7) "pink" falls into the color category. Option (A) has the following adjective order: [4. shape] [3. age] [6. origin] [7. material] [2. size] [1. opinion] [5. color] (or, in numeric terms, 4 3 6 7 2 1 5). Because 4 < 3 < 6 < 7 < 2 < 1 < 5 is correct, (A) has the correct ordering.
Option (B): "awful tiny new triangular pink Vietnamese steel match". Option (B) has the following adjective order: [1. opinion] [2. size] [3. age] [4. shape] [5. color] [6. origin] [7. material] (or, in numeric terms, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7). Because 1 < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 7 is correct, (B) has the correct ordering. Therefore, the answer is (B).

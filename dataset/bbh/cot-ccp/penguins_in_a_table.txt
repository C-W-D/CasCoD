Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
How many penguins are less than 8 years old and weight more than 12 kg?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

Right Response: This question focuses on age and weight. We know the following: Louis is 7 years old and weighs 11 kg, Bernard is 5 years old and weighs 13 kg, Vincent is 9 years old and weighs 11 kg, and Gwen is 8 years old and weighs 15 kg.

Now, we add James to this table: James is 12 years old and weighs 12 kg.

The penguins that are less than 8 years old and weigh more than 12 kg are none.

There are no penguins that meet both criteria. Therefore, the answer is (A).

Wrong Response: This question focuses on two attributes: age and weight. We know the following: Louis is 7 years old and weighs 11 kg, Bernard is 5 years old and weighs 13 kg, Vincent is 9 years old and weighs 11 kg, and Gwen is 8 years old and weighs 15 kg. Now, we add James to this table: James is 12 years old and weighs 12 kg. The penguins that are less than 8 years old and weigh more than 12 kg are Gwen and James. There are 2 penguins that meet these criteria. Therefore, the answer is (B).

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  Which penguin is taller than the other ones?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard

(D) Gwen
(E) James

Right Response: This question focuses on height. We know the following: Louis is 50 cm tall, Bernard is 80 cm tall, Vincent is 60 cm tall, and Gwen is 70 cm tall.
Comparing their heights, we can see that Bernard (80 cm) is taller than the other penguins.
Bernard is taller than the other ones. Therefore, the answer is (B).

Wrong Response: This question focuses on height. We know the following: Louis is 50 cm tall, Bernard is 80 cm tall, Vincent is 60 cm tall, Gwen is 70 cm tall, and James is 90 cm tall.
Comparing their heights, we can see that James is taller than all the other penguins.
The penguin that is taller than the other ones is James. Therefore, the answer is (E).

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.

Question Description: Solve multi-step arithmetic problems.
You need to complete the Wrong Response which requires you give the most likely incorrect answer to the question and the rationale for the incorrect answer. The incorrect answer and rationale in the Wrong Response must be different from the correct answer and rationale in the Right Response.

Q: ((5 * 7 * -4 + 7) * (-5 - -6 + -8 * -5)) =

Right Response: Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A * B", where A = (5 * 7 * -4 + 7) and B = (-5 - -6 + -8 * -5).
Let's calculate A = (5 * 7 * -4 + 7) = ((5 * 7) * -4 + 7) = ((35) * -4 + 7) = (-140 + 7) = -133.
Let's calculate B = (-5 - -6 + -8 * -5) = (-5 - (-6) + (-8 * -5)) = (-5 + 6 + (-8 * -5)) = (-5 + 6 + 40) = 41.
Then, the final equation is A * B = -133 * 41 = -5453. Therefore, the answer is -5453.

Let's calculate A = (5 * 7 * -4 + 7) = ((5 * 7) * -4 + 7) = ((35) * -4 + 7) = (-140 + 7) = -133.
Let's calculate B = (-5 - -6 + -8 * -5) = (-5 - (-6) + (-8 * -5)) = (-5 + 6 + (-8 * -5)) = (-5 + 6 + 40) = 41.
Then, the final equation is A * B = -133 * 41 = -5463. Therefore, the answer is -5463.

Q: ((8 + 3 * -8 - -8) - (2 + 2 * -9 - 6)) =

Right Response: Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A - B", where A = (8 + 3 * -8 - -8) and B = (2 + 2 * -9 - 6).
Let's calculate A = (8 + 3 * -8 - -8) = (8 + (3 * -8) - -8) = (8 + (-24) - (-8)) = (8 + (-24 + 8)) = (8 + (-16)) = -8.
Let's calculate B = (2 + 2 * -9 - 6) = (2 + (2 * -9) - 6) = (2 + (-18) - 6) = (2 + (-18 - 6)) = (2 + (-24)) = -22.
Then, the final equation is A - B = -8 - (-22) = -8 + 22 = 14. Therefore, the answer is 14.

Let's calculate A = (8 + 3 * -8 - -8) = (8 + (3 * -8) - -8) = (8 + (-24) - -8) = (8 + -24 + 8) = (-16).
Let's calculate B = (2 + 2 * -9 - 6) = (2 + (2 * -9) - 6) = (2 + (-18) - 6) = (2 - 18 - 6) = (-16).
Then, the final equation is A - B = (-16) - (-16) = -16 + 16 = 0. Therefore, the answer is 0.

Q: ((7 - 5 * 7 + -1) + (6 * 4 - 9 + -7)) =

Right Response: Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A + B", where A = (7 - 5 * 7 + -1) and B = (6 * 4 - 9 + -7).
Let's calculate A = (7 - 5 * 7 + -1) = (7 - (5 * 7) + -1) = (7 - (35) + -1) = (7 - 35 + -1) = (-28 + -1) = -29.
Let's calculate B = (6 * 4 - 9 + -7) = ((6 * 4) - 9 + -7) = ((24) - 9 + -7) = (24 - 9 + -7) = (15 + -7) = 8.
Then, the final equation is A + B = -29 + 8 = -21. Therefore, the answer is -21.

Let's calculate B = (6 * 4 - 9 + -7) = ((6 * 4) - 9 + -7) = ((24) - 9 + -7) = (24 - 9 + -7) = 15 + -7 = 8.
Then, the final equation is A + B = -30 + 8 = -22. Therefore, the answer is -22.

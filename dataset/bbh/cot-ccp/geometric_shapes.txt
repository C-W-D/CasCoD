Q: This SVG path element <path d="M 56.65,48.82 L 49.88,51.20 L 41.54,46.34 M 41.54,46.34 L 38.84,38.12 L 40.98,27.02 L 53.70,25.47 L 61.07,31.46 M 61.07,31.46 L 61.50,43.21 M 61.50,43.21 L 56.65,48.82"/> draws a
Options:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

Right Response: This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).

This path can be decomposed into 8 separate commands.
(1) M 56.65,48.82: Move the current point to 56.65,48.82.
(2) L 49.88,51.20: Create a line from 56.65,48.82 to 49.88,51.20.
(3) L 41.54,46.34: Create a line from 49.88,51.20 to 41.54,46.34.
(4) M 41.54,46.34: Move the current point to 41.54,46.34.
(5) L 38.84,38.12: Create a line from 41.54,46.34 to 38.84,38.12.
(6) L 40.98,27.02: Create a line from 38.84,38.12 to 40.98,27.02.
(7) L 53.70,25.47: Create a line from 40.98,27.02 to 53.70,25.47.
(8) M 61.07,31.46: Move the current point to 61.07,31.46.
(9) L 61.50,43.21: Create a line from 61.07,31.46 to 61.50,43.21.
(10) L 56.65,48.82: Create a line from 61.50,43.21 to 56.65,48.82.

This SVG path starts at point 56.65,48.82, creates seven consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back to its starting point, thereby creating an eight-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "octagon" is the only eight-sided object on the list. Therefore, the answer is (F).

Wrong Response: This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 8 separate commands.
(1) M 56.65,48.82: Move the current point to 56.65,48.82.
(2) L 49.88,51.20: Create a line from 56.65,48.82 to 49.88,51.20.
(3) L 41.54,46.34: Create a line from 49.88,51.20 to 41.54,46.34.
(4) M 41.54,46.34: Move the current point to 41.54,46.34.
(5) L 38.84,38.12: Create a line from 41.54,46.34 to 38.84,38.12.
(6) L 40.98,27.02: Create a line from 38.84,38.12 to 40.98,27.02.
(7) L 53.70,25.47: Create a line from 40.98,27.02 to 53.70,25.47.
(8) L 61.07,31.46: Create a line from 53.70,25.47 to 61.07,31.46.
(9) M 61.07,31.46: Move the current point to 61.07,31.46.
(10) L 61.50,43.21: Create a line from 61.07,31.46 to 61.50,43.21.
(11) M 61.50,43.21: Move the current point to 61.50,43.21.
(12) L 56.65,48.82: Create a line from 61.50,43.21 to 56.65,48.82.
This SVG path starts at point 56.65,48.82, creates multiple consecutive lines, and then returns back to its starting point. It does not form a closed shape. Therefore, the answer is (E) line.

(8) L 77.37,27.19: Create a line from 57.18,30.28 to 77.37,27.19.

This SVG path starts at point 77.37,27.19, creates four consecutive and touching lines, moves to a new point 44.39,14.63, creates another line, and then moves to a new point 57.18,30.28 and creates the final line. It does not have any curves or arches. This shape has five sides, so it is a "pentagon". Therefore, the answer is (G).

Wrong Response: This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).

This path can be decomposed into 7 separate commands.
(1) M 77.37,27.19: Move the current point to 77.37,27.19.

This SVG path starts at point 77.37,27.19, creates six consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back to its starting point, thereby creating a six-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "hexagon" is the only six-sided polygon on the list. Therefore, the answer is (C).
